Inspired by [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/), a program which recognizes a hand-drawn symbol and provides the Latex command for it.

Tikz is a Latex library which allows the drawing of pictures. However, creating one in Latex is a tedious process.

Detikify is a drag-and-drop editor to make Tikz picture creation easier.

The ultimate goal of this project is to generate Latex and Tikz code for a user's hand-drawn picture.
